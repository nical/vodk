 - basic 2d game engine features
 - all the assets should be able to be reloaded without restarting the game/levels
 - compile to javascript using emscripten out of the box
 - developpement happens on Linux but the engine should be easily portable
 - lua scripting
 - use it at game jams

At the moment there isn't much implemented yet.
